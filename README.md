# DSC210-FA22-Final-Project


Code base for DSC 210 Fall 22 Final Project on NonNegative Factorization


This project compares topic modelling techniques on Headlines dataset and Presidential speech dataset. In particular we are using LDA and NMF on both datasets and comparing the results.  
Here you can know more on the datasets.

## Code-Base Structure
We have 4 notebooks applying a model on a dataset. 
LDA-Headlines dataset
NMF-Headlines dataset
LDA-Presidential speech dataset
NMF-Presidential speech dataset

## Instructions to run notebook that runs LDA on Headlines
Running on colab:

Download the dataset from the link given above and upload it to your google drive's root folder.
There is a cell in the notebook to connect to google drive which will ask the permission to connect to drive.
After that you can just sequentially run all the cells and get the results.
Note the cell that trains the lda models takes a lot of time to run so keep some patience.

Running on local:

Download the dataset from the link given above and upload it to your google drive's root folder.
You do not need to run the cell that connects to google drive.
Change the path to read the dataset to you local machines current path.
After that you can just sequentially run all the cells and get the results.
Note the cell that trains the lda models takes a lot of time to run so keep some patience.
